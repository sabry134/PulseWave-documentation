## OneCycle Application

In order to get a graphic as a result of the inputted video, you would need to use the OneCycle application.

First of all, open Matlab and make sure to be in the correct repository. The repository name is "Pulse Wave". Once you're in the correct repository, in the terminal type "one_cycles". Therefore it should open an application like this:

Once this is open, click on "Load files". Among all the files, you have to select the video you'd like to analyse. Once the video is added, it should show an information saying it has been set as the video which will be analysed. You can or not enable the "Segmentation AV" mode. Once you did set everything you need for your analysis. Click on "execute". 

After you did so, the green circle icon should become red. It means the application is doing all the necessary calculations to give an analysis as a result. Once the circle icon becomes green again, more windows should appear. For our case this will give the result of the pulse wave analysis.

Here's an example of result you can expect:

The application itself is made to remove any uncomplete cycles. Which means that all the time you will be able to get a complete cycle analysis.

We'll see in the next chapter the explanations of the analysis results.

## Input and Output explanations

As you can see, the cycle is regular, it goes up and down like in the example below:

When the cycle goes up, it stands for a diastole. As a reminder, a diastole is a rhythmically recurrent expansion especially : the relaxation and dilation of the chambers of the heart and especially the ventricles during which they fill with blood. And when the cycle goes down, it stands for a systole. As a reminder, a systole is a rhythmically recurrent contraction especially : the contraction of the heart by which the blood is forced out of the chambers and into the aorta and pulmonary artery.

Further explanations will be added soon!
